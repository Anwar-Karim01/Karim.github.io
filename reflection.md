#Reflection on Learning Experience and Artifact Creation

Exploring neural networks with the TensorFlow Neural Network Playground was both enjoyable and informative. Hands-on experimentation allowed me to see how modifications in layers, neurons, activation functions, and learning rates affected a model's performance. This participatory approach helped to consolidate my comprehension of fundamental concepts like weights, loss functions, and optimization techniques.

Creating the visual presentation allowed me to break down each neural network component in a clear and organized manner. Designing the presentations forced me to consider how to express technical knowledge graphically and succinctly. This technique strengthened my understanding of neural network architecture and enhanced my ability to express complex concepts in a clear manner.
