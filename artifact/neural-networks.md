# Artifact: Visualizing Neural Networks

**Objective:**  
To illustrate how data flows through input, hidden, and output layers using TensorFlow Playground.

**Process:**  
- Explored datasets and hyperparameters  
- Captured screenshots of training curves and decision boundaries  
- Created slide deck with component definitions  

**Tools:**  
TensorFlow Playground, PowerPoint, Canva

**Value Proposition:**  
Demonstrates my ability to translate abstract ML concepts into clear, visual artifacts.
